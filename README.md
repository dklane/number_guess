## Problem statement:
Write a program that plays the traditional “guess-a-number” game. The program establishes the “winning” number between 1 and 10 and then allows the user to try to guess the number.
## Requirements:
1. Accepts user input.
1. Checks that input is numeric.
1. Converts numeric input to an integer.
1. Checks that the guess is in the range of valid numbers (1-10).
1. Uses the randint() random number function to pick the number.
1. Sets the maximum number as a variable (number_max).
1. Uses a while loop to give the user 3 tries to get the right answer.
1. The while statement goes ahead of the input() statement.
1. The while loop requires the programmer to reindent various blocks.
1. The while loop requires the programmer to reword some of the messages.

## Algorithm (include elements of your algorithm as program comments).

## Test plan (define the inputs you will provide and the expected output):
